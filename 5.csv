Abstract: This short article provides an analysis of the
impact of Russia’s food embargo on domestic producers.
It is part of an occasional series of non-peer-reviewed
texts that explain current events.
"After the Russian annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in March 2014, the U.S., the EU and a number of other countries imposed economic"
sanctions on Russia. Western sanctions targeted Russian companies
"and individuals, banning visas, freezing assets and restricting trade of"
"certain Russian financial products and technologies. On August 7, 2014,"
"Russia retaliated with an embargo on agricultural products from the U.S.,"
"Canada, EU, Norway and Australia. The embargo banned a long list of"
"food products including beef, pork, poultry, fish and other seafood, fluid"
"milk, vegetables and potatoes, fruits, nuts and various processed foods like"
"sausages and dairy products. Baby food, live animals, seeds and a number"
of specialized ingredients for food and animal feed (minerals and vitamins
"integral to livestock feed, for example) were excluded from the ban.1"
The fact that agriculture was at the heart of counter-sanctions is
itself quite interesting. The food embargo demonstrates that the coun-
try’s dependence on imported food was a central concern of the Russian
government. This anxiety has been evident in agricultural reform policies
known collectively as the food security agenda that aimed at strengthening
domestic producers and reducing Russia’s dependence on foreign agri-
cultural and food imports. The political salience of food security was on
"display on a few occasions in 2015, when Rosselkhoznadzor, the Russian"
"1 Decree No. 778 of 7 August 2014. For full text in English, see USDA FAS GAIN Report"
“Russian Food Ban Extended Until August 2016.” 6/25/2015. Report No. RS1540.
