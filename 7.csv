"",Russian food embaRgo: minoR losses

"","V.Uzun, D.Loginova"
"",Most of the countries counter-sanctioned by Russia have seen no decline in
"","food exports, increasing them to other countries to compensate for losses"
"",in the Russian market. Only a few countries have experienced a decline in
"","exports due to the Russian food embargo, namely Norway (a total decline of"
"","11.3%, of which the Russian market accounts for 10.1%), Finland (respectively"
"","24.5% and 20.9%), Lithuania (20.7% and 20.6%), Latvia (21.5% and 11.5%),"
"","Estonia (22.8% and 12.2%), Poland (4.8% and 4.6%). 1"
"",There is an established opinion in Russia that the countries that sup-
"",port sanctions against Russia have sustained considerable losses due to the
"",Russian food embargo. There are few publications that prove it wrong2. Mass
"",media and economic literature generally assess the effect of the food embar-
"",go using data showing the decline in import volumes from these countries
"","to Russia3. However, the respective losses should be assessed given both the"
"",decline in exports to Russia and the changes in exports to the markets of
"",other countries.
"",The Table (see the Attachment hereto) shows that food exports to Russia
"","from the counter-sanctioned countries fell sharply (by $12.4bn) in 2015, as"
"","compared to 2013. The deepest decline was seen in Norway ($1134m), USA"
"","($914m), EU member countries as a whole ($9634m), including Germany"
"","($1162m), Lithuania ($1284m), The Netherlands ($1071m), Poland ($1027m)."
"",The overwhelming majority of these countries have seen exports decline
"",not only to Russia but also to other countries over the same period. The big-
"",gest losses ($61.9bn)  have been sustained by EU member countries ($14bn
"","by The Netherlands, more than $10bn by France and Germany each, $8bn"
"","by Belgium). In fact, these countries sustained inconsiderable losses in the"
"",Russian market amid the overall decline in exports from these countries. For
"","example, exports in Slovakia dropped 28.9%, with losses in the Russian mar-"
"","ket being as little as 0.8%. Exports in France fell 15.6%, losing 0.9% in the"
"",Russian market.
"","At the same time, some countries sustained major losses in the Russian"
"","market. For example, Norway lost 11.3% in the global market, of which the"
"",Russian market accounted for 10.1%. Finland saw its entire food exports fall
